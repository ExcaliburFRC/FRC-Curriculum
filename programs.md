# Programs/Applications
There are quite a few programs/applications that we use, all of them should be on your computer.
- [WPILib (latest)](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/tag/v2020.3.2): This downloads multiple utilities and tools and configures the computer so it can be used for FRC development.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/): A useful application to ease git usage. Optional - if you prefer using git through a command-line interface, have fun!
    - The GitHub Desktop installer also installs Git. If you choose not to install GitHub Desktop, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer.
- A Java IDE: There are many options, but these are the two we use and you should know to use.
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): A free, light, open-source IDE with extensions for almost any language. The WPILib extension and the Java extension package should be installed too. A fully-configured VS Code can be installed by the WPILib installer, so a seperate install is unnecessary.
  - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/): An advanced Java IDE. The FRC plugin is helpful, but optional. This is the main IDE we use for development.
## Accounts 
- You should have a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. Note: please pick a normal username, possibly not based on your name.

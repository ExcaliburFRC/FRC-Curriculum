# Lesson 09 - Code Analysis

### Description:
A relatively easy lesson. Each `Ex*.java` file in the `/q/` folder contains a function or a few connected functions, with no documentation and badly named variables/parameters. 
The subteam should then analyze the code and decipher what the code does. 
The parallel files in the `/a/` folder contain the same functions, with documentation and relevantly-named variables/parameters.
If the subteam is on an especially high level and time is not an issue, perhaps they can try to find weaknesses in the code.

### Depends On:
  - `Set`/`List` mechanics
  - Basic understanding of Generics - a simple explanation when going over relevant code might be sufficient
  - Basic understanding of `Comparator` - a simple explanation when going over relevant code might be sufficient

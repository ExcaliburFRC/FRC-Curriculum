# Lesson 11 - Actuators & Sensors

### Description
Learn about more advanced components and control of them.

### Topics:
- vendordeps (if not covered in 10)
- pneumatics (if not covered in 10)
- sensors (`DigitalInput`, `Encoder`, `Ultrasonic`, `AHRS`?)
- onboard PID (if subteam has knowledge of PID)
- reading limelight values?

### Practice
#### `Limelight` class
Writing a `Limelight` class alone (subteam without mentor/lead help), 
while researching the [Limelight docs](https://docs.limelightvision.io/en/latest/)

#### Robot Code
Sends sensor data to dashboard, controls actuators by joystick
